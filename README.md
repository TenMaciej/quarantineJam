# quarantineJam

Casual game for up to 4 players with split screen based on physics. Game jam classic. I've finally finished game jam since Global Game Jam 2017 so that's big deal for me. Scope size not great not terrible. I didn't have time and strenght for audio, SFX or VFX, but anyway I'm glad it's playable.
